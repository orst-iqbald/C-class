1. How is the graph stored in the provided code -- adjacency matrix or edge list?
    As an edge list
2. Which of the graphs are connected? How can you tell?
    A graph is connected if there is a path from each vertex to every other vertex. In this case graph 3 is connected as it has 26 vertices
3. Imagine that we ran each search in the other direction (from destination to source, instead of source to
destination) -- would the output change at all? What if the graphs were directed graphs?
    There would be no change in output since we have an undirected graph. If the graph were directed there would be a change in output.
4. What are a few pros and cons of DFS vs. BFS?
    + BFS is like ink, it will find a path
    + BFS will not get stuck in an infiting path
    - BFS may take a long time to find a solution since it goes through each vertex
    + DFS can find the solution faster if it doesn't get stuck
    - DFS may get stuck in an infinite path or may have to reverse itself for a while if it gets stuck in teh wrong path
5. What's the Big O execution time to determine if a node is reachable from another node?
    O(E+V)
